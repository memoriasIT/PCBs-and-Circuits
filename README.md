# PCBs-and-Circuits
Most CPU's don't work, they are just prototypes just used Logisim to make the graphic of the concepts.
They can work with some tweaking tho.


## Working Circuits
* Fibonacci
* 32bit - Final - CPU SingleCicle

## Just Prototypes
* 16bit - V1 - Lil'HexCrusher
* 16bit - V2 - HexCrusher
* 32bit - ALU-Cination9000 - 2 phase
* 32bit - V2 - CHIPY SingleCicle
